# Sales Data Analysis and Reporting for a Retail Chain

Objective:-
The aim of this project is to use Python, SQL, and Excel to analyze sales data and generate meaningful reports for a retail chain.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Methodology:-
✔ Data Acquisition and Preparation:
  ➡ Data Sourcing: Obtained sales data in CSV format from Kaggle and established a secure local storage path.
  ➡ Database Design and Implementation: Constructed a SQL database schema tailored to the dataset, creating necessary tables using SQL DDL commands to efficiently store and manage data.
  ➡ Data Cleaning and Validation: Employed SQL queries and Python (Pandas) to meticulously identify and rectify data inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers, ensuring data integrity.
  ➡ Data Enrichment: Generated calculated fields (e.g., total sales, month/year) using SQL and Python to expand dataset utility for in-depth analysis.
  
✔ Exploratory and Advanced Analysis:
   ➡ Descriptive Analysis: Utilized SQL and Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to uncover initial data patterns, trends, and relationships through summary statistics and visualizations.
   ➡ In-depth Analysis: Conducted sophisticated analyses such as time series forecasting, cohort analysis, and customer segmentation using Python's advanced libraries to derive actionable insights.
   
✔ Reporting and Visualization:
   ➡ Report Generation: Produced comprehensive tabular reports (sales by product, store, time period) using SQL and Python, and formatted them in Excel for clarity and professionalism.
   ➡ Data Visualization: Created compelling visual representations (charts, graphs) using Python's visualization libraries to effectively communicate complex findings.
   ➡ Dashboard Development: Integrated tabular and visual reports into an interactive Excel dashboard to provide a holistic view of sales performance and facilitate data-driven decision-making.
